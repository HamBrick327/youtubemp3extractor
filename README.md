## warning, this code is written by the ape equvalent of a developer
In order to get the spotify client secret and ID, you need to make a spotify dev account at [developer.spotify.com](developer.spotify.com)
I put mine on here so I'd prefer you don't violate ToS with my credentials, but no one is gonna look at this so I'm not too worried about it.

### TODO
refactor to make the code not suck and slightly more readable
find a way around age restrictions without leaking my credentials to github
