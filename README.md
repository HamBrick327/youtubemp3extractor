## warning, this code is written by the ape equvalent of a developer
In order to get the spotify client secret and ID, you need to make a spotify dev account at [developer.spotify.com](developer.spotify.com)

playlists work now, my next step is to add some user input instead of just making you shift though all the variables and reverse engineer all my garbage code
